# Simply Love Features

### GameModes

* [Casual](http://imgur.com/zLLhDWQh.png) – Intended for novice players; restricted song list, no failing, no LifeMeter, simplified UI, etc.  You can read more about customizing what content appears in Casual Mode [here](./CasualMode-README.md).
* [ITG](http://imgur.com/HS03hhJh.png) – Play using the *In the Groove* standards established over a decade ago
* [FA+](http://imgur.com/teZtlbih.png) – Similar to ITG, but features tighter TimingWindows; can be used to qualify for ECFA events

### Auxiliary Features

  * [Live Step Statistics](https://imgur.com/w4ddgSK.png) – This optional gameplay overlay tracks how many of each judgment have been earned in real time and features a notes-per-second density histogram.  This can make livestreaming more interesting for viewers.
  * [Judgment Scatter Plot](https://imgur.com/JK5Li2w.png) – ScreenEvaluation now features a judgment scatterplot where notes hit early are rendered "below the middle" and notes hit late are rendered "above the middle." This can offer insight into how a player performed over time. Did the player gradually hit notes earlier and earlier as the song wore on? This feature can help players answer such questions.
  * [Judgment Density Histogram](https://imgur.com/FAuieAf.png) – The evaluation screen also now features a histogram that will help players assess whether they are more often hitting notes early or late.
  * [Per-Column Judgment Breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/TaApeGB.png)
  * [QR Code Integration with GrooveStats](https://i.imgur.com/TaApeGB.png) – Evaluation now displays a QR code that will upload the score you just earned to your [GrooveStats](http://groovestats.com/) account.
  * [IIDX-inspired Pacemaker](http://imgur.com/NwN8Fnbh.png)
  * improved MeasureCounter – Stepcharts can now be parsed ahead of time, so it is no longer necessary to play through a stepchart at least once to acquire a stream breakdown.
